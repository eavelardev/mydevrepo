Optional Reading: Feedforward Neural Networks in Depth
Fâ€‹or a more in depth explaination of Feedforward Neural Networks, one of our DLS mentors has written some [articles](https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/feedforward-neural-networks-in-depth/98811) (optional reading) on them. If these interest you, do check them out.

A huge shoutout and thanks to **Jonas Lalin!**
