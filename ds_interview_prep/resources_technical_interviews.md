## Online Courses:
- [Intro to Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-algorithms--cs215) Course on Udacity: The course you just completed is essentially a prerequisite of the Intro to Algorithms course. Intro to Algorithms is largely about graph algorithmsâ€”you likely won't need most of them for interviews, but if you're interested in graph algorithms this is a great next step!
